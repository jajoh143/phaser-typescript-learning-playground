# Module 4: Platformer - week-02 - day-04

## Session Goal
Add a lightweight lives counter.

## 30-Minute Plan
- 10 min: Read existing relevant code and identify one small change.
- 15 min: Implement the targeted change for today.
- 5 min: Run, verify behavior, and write one quick note on what you learned.

## Deliverable
- One working code update committed to your branch.
- One short reflection note in commit message or local notes.

## Stretch (Optional)
- Add one small polish improvement if time remains.
